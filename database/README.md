### Database Service
This microservice is for the PostgreSQL database

#### Connecting to the database manually
You can connect to the database by typing `psql postgresql://admin:isolated-dean-primal-starving@localhost:5433/day_trader`
from your terminal after you have started the container. Port 5433 is used so as not to interfere with the postgres on your computer
